## Warning

(Will try to translate french `readme` to this one later)

Please have in mind 
* This code was written in 2007
* It seems i commented stuff in French
* It was originally posted here : http://codes-sources.commentcamarche.net/source/45570-interop-xchat-net-chargeur-de-plugins-manages

Before this project I never heard of :
* AppDomain
* Real reflection
* Assembly Loading
* never done C++
* never done C++ Cli
* did C# for only 1 year
* had no notion of Marshalling (even after)
* the ASM code inside was not written by me (PC were half x86 x64), i still do not understand any single line of it, and someone explained me that it probably crash on x64

There's bugs inside this code but i still use it as a POC for smoth integration between native world and Managed world
And this is cleary not an example to follow ;)
